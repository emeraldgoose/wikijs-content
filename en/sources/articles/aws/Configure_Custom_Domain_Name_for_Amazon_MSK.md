## Problem

Amazon MSK advertises broker endpoints with AWS-generated hostnames. Enterprises that put Kafka behind corporate DNS conventions, private certificate authorities, or firewall allow-lists need **custom domain names** on the advertised listeners, so clients connect to `kafka.corp.example.com` instead of opaque broker hostnames — without reconfiguring every producer and consumer on rotation.

## Solution path

- **NLB + DNS + ACM certificate**: place a Network Load Balancer in front of the brokers, map custom DNS records to it, and terminate TLS with an AWS Certificate Manager certificate for the custom domain.
- **Advertised listener change**: set the per-broker custom advertised listener configuration (the modern equivalent of the legacy `custom.advertised.listeners` CLI override) so brokers tell clients to reconnect via the custom hostname.
- **Two-phase rollout**: (1) establish the networking path (NLB, DNS, certificate) first; (2) flip the advertised listener so cutover is automatic for clients.
- **Same behavior on ZooKeeper and KRaft**: the mechanism works identically on both metadata modes.
- **Scaling and failover safe**: automatic broker scaling and broker replacement re-apply the configuration, so the custom name survives topology changes.
- **Availability**: supported on all MSK Provisioned clusters (Standard and Express brokers).

## Takeaways for the seminar

- Rolling networking first and config second makes the cutover hitless — clients never need simultaneous reconfiguration.
- Custom advertised listeners are a prerequisite pattern for corporate Kafka adoption (mTLS identity, DNS policy, audit), and they compose with the in-place ZooKeeper-to-KRaft upgrade path rather than conflicting with it.
