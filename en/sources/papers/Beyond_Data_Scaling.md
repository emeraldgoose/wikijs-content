## Abstract

Vision-language-action (VLA) models are usually improved by scaling robot trajectory data, but robot data is scarce and costly to collect. Under a fixed robot-data budget, continued pre-training must turn limited trajectories into transferable visual-action knowledge rather than merely fit actions — making representation quality a central bottleneck. We propose VLAct, a VLA-oriented VLM backbone trained on broad, heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data before task-specific fine-tuning. VLAct preserves the broad VLM prior and encourages shared action semantics across embodiments through VLM-prior preservation, multi-head continuous action co-supervision, and a partially unified cross-embodiment action layout, while allowing task-specific action heads during fine-tuning. Results are obtained using fully open-source data and only a 16-GPU training setup, showing that representation-centric continued pre-training delivers highly competitive performance under a modest compute budget and is an important independent axis of VLA progress beyond data scaling.

## Key Contributions

- Frames VLA progress as representation quality, not just data volume: an independent axis beyond data scaling
- VLAct: a VLA-oriented VLM backbone (Qwen3-VL-4B based) continued-pretrained on broad, heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data
- Three continued-pretraining principles: preserve the VLM prior, share action semantics across embodiments, scaffold with pretraining heads discarded at fine-tuning time
- Partially unified cross-embodiment action layout: shared semantics without pretending robots are identical (embodiment-specific dims remain)
- Open recipe: fully open-source data, 16-GPU setup, public weights (`StarVLA/VLAct_Qwen3_Pretrain`), training pipelines and dataset-prep scripts

## Methodology

Continued pre-training sits between the base VLM and downstream task fine-tuning. The full model is unfrozen again during downstream fine-tuning; continued-pretraining action heads act as scaffolding and are replaced by freshly initialized task-specific heads.

1. **VLM-prior preservation** — keep what the VLM already knows. Caption supervision anchors broad visual and semantic knowledge during continued pre-training so robot-action learning does not wash out the general vision-language prior. Ablations on the vision-language data mixture show the prior-preservation term is load-bearing.
2. **Multi-head continuous action co-supervision** — joint supervision over continuous action heads across embodiments encourages shared, transferable action semantics instead of overfitting to one robot's action distribution.
3. **Partially unified cross-embodiment action layout** — compares three layouts: separate per-embodiment heads, naively unified (forces all robots into one space), and partially unified (shared semantic subspace + embodiment-specific dimensions). The partial layout wins: it shares what transfers while keeping what differs.

Training data is broad, heterogeneous, multi-embodiment open-source robot data; dataset-preparation scripts and run scripts are public in the VLAct repo.

## Results

- **Unseen embodiment generalization**: on RoboCasa-GR1 (unseen humanoid embodiment), a VLA using VLAct with only 20% of downstream trajectories outperforms the full-data GR00T-N1.6 baseline — the headline data-efficiency result.
- **Broad competitiveness**: strong results across simulations and seen embodiments despite the modest 16-GPU budget.
- **Ablations**: caption-mixture ablations confirm VLM-prior preservation matters; action-space comparisons favor the partially unified layout over separate or naively unified heads.
- **Efficiency claim**: competitive performance without proprietary data scale — representation work substitutes for raw trajectory volume.

## Limitations / Open Questions

- Continued pre-training still needs diverse multi-embodiment data curation; the recipe reduces but does not eliminate data dependence.
- Partially unified layout requires per-embodiment design decisions (which dims to share) — not fully automatic.
- Evaluation centers on manipulation/humanoid benchmarks (RoboCasa-style); very long-horizon and contact-rich tasks remain open.

## Relevance to Software Engineers

For SW engineers building robot stacks: start from the continued-pretraining backbone (`StarVLA/VLAct_Qwen3_Pretrain`) as the default adaptation base for a new robot, dataset, or action head instead of fine-tuning a raw VLM. Keep caption/prior-preservation data in your continued-pretraining mix, use a partially unified action layout when serving multiple embodiments, and treat pretraining action heads as throwaway scaffolding. The practical payoff is data efficiency — matching or beating full-data baselines with a fraction of downstream trajectories on a modest GPU budget.
